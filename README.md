# Wellness walk competition

Helping some of my friends get off there lazy asses. This dApp puts your money where your mmouth is.

The walk competition dApp asks users to log in with their meta mask wallet and strava account.

The host can select a start and end date and place bet. Send link to other friedns so they can join and place bet.

Once the comp starts every week the contract will get data from strava on how many miles each user has done and updates the table.

The table can be viewwed on site. once time is up contract will calculate who walked the furthest and empty the contract and send funds to winners wallet. 

*Quick overview will update this summary later once more of the contract is built. WOOOOOOOOOOOOO
